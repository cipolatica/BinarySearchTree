# BinarySearchTree
This is a generic Binary Search Tree class made in Swift. This BST class uses an enum for its node (BST_Node).


# Methods:

public func getSize() -> Int \n
Returns the number of nodes in the BST


public func insert(value: T) -> Bool  \r
Insert a value into the BST. This BST does not insert duplicate values.
Returns true if value was inserted into the BST, false otherwise
Runtime: O(h) where h is the height of the tree


public func remove(value: T) -> Bool  \r\n
Remove a value from the BST.
Returns true if value was removed, false otherwise (if value wasn't in BST)
Runtime: O(h) where h is the height of the tree


public func contains(value: T) -> Bool
Checks if value is contained within the BST
Returns true if value is present, false otherwise
Runtime: O(h) where h is the height of the tree


public func isBST(min: T, max: T) -> Bool
Checks if BST is a valid binary search tree. i.e. left nodes are smaller and right nodes are larger
Returns true if BST is valid, false otherwiseand
Runtime: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree


public func findLCA(v1: T, v2: T) -> T?
Finds lowest common ancestor of two particular values in the BST
Return the value of the LCA, or nil if there is no LCA
Runtime: O(h) where h is the height of the tree


public func isBalanced() -> Bool
Checks if BST is balanced.
Returns true if the longest height of the tree and shortest height of the tree are within 1 level apart.
Runtime: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree


public func printPreOrder()
Prints the BST via Pre Order traversal


public func printInOrder()
Prints the BST via In Order traversal


public func printPostOrder()
Prints the BST via Post Order traversal


public func printBFS()
Prints the BST via Breadth First Search traversal
